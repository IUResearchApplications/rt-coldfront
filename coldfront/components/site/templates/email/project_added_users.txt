Dear {{ center_name }} user,

These users have been added to the project "{{ project_title }}" by {{ action_user }}.
{% for project_user in project_users %}{{ project_user.user.first_name }} {{ project_user.user.last_name }} ({{ project_user.user.username }})
{% endfor %}
They can view the project here:
{{ url }}

Resource access is not automatically granted to project users, they must be added to an allocation as well.

Thank you,
{{ signature }}
