Dear {{ center_name }} user,

These users have been added to the project "{{ project_title }}" by {{ action_user }}.
{% for project_user in project_users %}{{ project_user.user.first_name }} {{ project_user.user.last_name }} ({{ project_user.user.username }})
{% endfor %}
They can view the project here:
{{ url }}

Being added to the project does not guarantee you have access to the resources you need. If you are unable
to use a resource visit the URL above and check the allocation list. If you do not see an allocation with the
resource you need listed then you need to contact a manager in your project about adding you to it.

Thank you,
