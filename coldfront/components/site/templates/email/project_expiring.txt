Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your access to {{center_name}} resources is expiring soon. To renew, login to RT Projects and
complete the short renewal process for each expiring project. Failure to renew the expiring RT project(s)
and its allocation(s) on time will terminate access to the resource for all users in the allocation(s).

Below is your expiring project(s):
{% spaceless %}
{% for project in project_dict %}
----------------------------------------------
Project Title: {{project.project.title}}
Project URL: {{ project.project_url }}
Project PI: {{ project.project.pi }}
Project Type: {{ project.project.type }}
Project Days Remaining: {{ expiring_in_days }}
{% if project.project.type.name == 'Class' %}
NOTE: This project cannot be renewed. The PI of this project will need to submit a new project.
{% endif %}
Allocations expiring soon:
{% for allocation in project.allocations %}    {{ allocation.get_parent_resource }}
{% empty %}    No allocations to list{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% endspaceless %}

The managers for these projects are required to renew them unless stated otherwise. The expiring allocations can be renewed during the project renewal.
If they are not they will need to be renewed separately. If you do not need any of these projects anymore we recommend archiving them, doing so will
expire all allocations with it. You can do so with the archive project button on your project's detail page. You will not receive renewal emails
for archived projects. Archiving a project does not affect any of the data within the resource allocations it has.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url|safe }}

If you are not the PI or a manager under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
