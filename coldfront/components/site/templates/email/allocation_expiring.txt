Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your access to Research Technologies resources is expiring soon. To renew, login to RT Projects and
complete the short renewal process for each expiring allocation. Failure to renew the expiring allocation(s)
will terminate access to the resource for all users in them

Below is a list of links to your project(s) containing at least one expiring allocation:
{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}
Project Title: {{project_key}}
Project URL: {{ project_url.0 }}
Project PI: {{ project_url.1 }}
Project Type: {{ project_url.3 }}
    {% spaceless %}{% for days_key, days_value in expiration_dict.items %}
    Allocation(s) expiring in {{days_key}} days:{% for allocations in days_value %}{% if allocations.0 == project_url.0 %}  
        {% spaceless %}{{ allocations.2 }}{% endspaceless %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}
{% endfor %}
The managers in these projects can renew the allocations. If they are not needed anymore you can safely ignore this email.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url|safe }}

If you are not the PI or a manager under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
