Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your access to {{center_name}} resources has expired. Any accounts under these RT project(s) and
allocation(s) are now unable to access the associated resource.

If you wish to continue using them, the managers responsible for the following project(s) must renew the expired
project(s) and allocation(s) before 7/31, after which the projects will be terminated and cannot be renewed.

Below is your expired project(s):
{% spaceless %}
{% for project in project_dict %}
----------------------------------------------
Project Title: {{project.project.title}}
Project URL: {{ project.project_url }}
Project PI: {{ project.project.pi }}
Project Type: {{ project.project.type }}
{% if project.project.type.name == 'Class' %}
NOTE: This project cannot be renewed. The PI of this project will need to submit a new project.
{% endif %}
Allocations expired:
{% for allocation in project.allocations %}    {{ allocation.get_parent_resource }}
{% empty %}    No allocations to list{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% endspaceless %}

The managers responsible for these projects are required to renew them unless stated otherwise. The
expired allocations can be renewed during the project renewal. If they are not they will need to be
renewed separately.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url|safe }}.

If you are not the PI or a manager under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
