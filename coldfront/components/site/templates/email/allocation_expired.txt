Dear {{center_name}} user,

Your access to {{center_name}} resources has expired. Any accounts under these allocation(s) are now unable to
access the associated resource.

If you wish to continue using them, the managers responsible for the following project(s) must renew the expired
allocations(s) before 7/31, after which the allocations will be terminated and cannot be renewed.

Below is a list of links to your project(s) containing at least one expired allocation: 
{% for project_key, project_url in project_dict.items %}
Project Title: {{project_key}}
Project URL: {{ project_url.0 }}
Project PI: {{ project_url.1 }} 
Project Type: {{ project_url.3 }}
    {% spaceless %} {% for allocation_key, allocation_value in allocation_dict.items %}{% if allocation_key == project_url.0 %}Expired Allocation(s):{% for allocation in allocation_value %}{% for allocation_url, resource_name in allocation.items %}
        {{ resource_name }} - {{ allocation_url }}{% endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}
{% endfor %}
The managers in these projects can renew the allocations. If they are not needed anymore you can safely ignore this email.
For more information about the yearly renewal, visit our knowledge base: {{ project_renewal_help_url }}.

If you are not the PI or a manager under this project, you are receiving this notice as a courtesy.

If you have any questions please email us at {{ help_email }}

Thank you,
