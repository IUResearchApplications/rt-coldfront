Dear {{ center_name }} user,

These users have been removed from project "{{ project_title }}". They no longer have access to any allocations in this project.
{% for removed_user in removed_users %}{{ removed_user.user.first_name }} {{ removed_user.user.last_name }} ({{ removed_user.user.username }})
{% endfor %}
Breakdown of resources each user no longer has access to:
{% spaceless %}{% for user, allocation_info in removed_users_breakdown.items %}
{{ user }}
-----------------
{% for allocation, identifiers in allocation_info %}{{ allocation }}{% if identifiers %}: {% for identifier in identifiers %}{{ identifier }},{% endfor %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}{% endfor %}{% endspaceless %}

Thank you,
{{ signature }}
